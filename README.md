# Operator SDK Workshop

This repository will serve as collection of exercises ranging from installation requirements to successfully building Operators for Kubernetes using the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk).


Exercises in this repository will be split into 3 distinct sections:

1. Kubernetes
2. Ansible/Helm
3. Operator SDK

### Section: Kubernetes
In this section we will review the basic Kubernetes CLI. We will also deploy applications using manifests.

### Section: Ansible/Helm
In this section we will go over Ansible playbooks alongside Helm Charts.

### Section: Operator SDK
In this section we will go over the Operator SDK and use our knowledge from the previous two sections to successfully deploy and maintain our applications.
